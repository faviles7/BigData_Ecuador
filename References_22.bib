abstract = {Natural disasters have proven that governments, even in developed countries, have difficulties to get up-to-date data about not only affected people but also the location and intensity of infrastructure damage when a country is shook by the nature. Therefore, knowing how mobility patterns are changing, in the post disaster time-frame, is crucial in order to settle rescue centers and send help to the most affected areas. In this scenario, we analyze the relations between human mobility patterns and the effects of an earthquake that shook Ecuador on April 16th, 2016. We do so using more than 11 millions of aggregated call detail records provided by Telefonica. We propose a metric named Reach Score to build timeseries as a way to characterize the residents geographic reach according to their mobile activity. Next, we define the metric Reach Score change, RiSC to capture differences in mobility among two given dates. Our results show that these two metrics calculated on data from the day before and the day after the disaster reflect both the overall change in mobility at the province level and the intensity of infrastructure damage at canton level. In fact, we obtain a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = -0.819 between the metric RiSC and the infrastructure damage score taken from official data.},

abstract = {Quantifying income inequalities in developing countries faces challenges regarding data publicly available. Census data, collected every five or ten years, is the only source for socioeconomic indicators. Thus, local authorities need ways of producing more frequently updated indicators. Studies conducted for developed countries (Europe and USA) use Call Detail Records (CDRs) for such a purpose. In our study we propose to exploit patterns observed in developing countries, specifically in Latin America, where mobile phone usage is pervasive even among the poorest and the dominant modality for purchasing mobile airtime is the prepaid scheme (top-ups). We analyze more than 1M top-up transactions together with more than 5K online classified ads for housing sales to predict the socioeconomic status measured at an intra-urban level for 89 neighborhoods. Using a Linear Regression with Regularization L1 (Lasso), we can explain the economic status with a prediction rate up to 71% for urban neighborhoods in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Consequently, we show evidence that top-up transactions provide effective signals to characterize urban neighborhoods socioeconomic status.},

Some regions are characterized by the high frequency of this type of natural phenomenon. Such is the case of Ecuador, a country with a high seismic index due to its location in a subduction zone between the Pacific Plate and the South American Plate. Predictions in the behavior of earthquakes are a way of prevention that allows taking measures according to vulnerability. Although it is difficult to accurately predict the occurrence of an earthquake, there are dissimilar types of analysis to observe its behavior and patterns of occurrence. The nature of earthquakes and their monitoring variables usually make up large databases. For its processing and subsequent analysis of the results, it is convenient to use statistical techniques of Data Mining such as K-Means. In this work, the classic K-Means method is combined with Neutrosophy to improve the results obtained by taking into account the indeterminacy of such complex data sets and including the diversity of the data and its fluctuation, due to the proximity among the boundaries and their membership clusters.},

So the current situation of the city is analyzed as well as the problem that traffic represent for Quito, subsequently the analysis of various cases throughout the world who have suffered the problem of traffic congestion is summarized and then is analized and related with solutions that have been taken and which have improved mobility in these cities. While the focus of this study is not to provide direct solutions to the problem of transportation but rather to present the diagnosis of the main problems. The study deepens with field research with 95% confidence to a total of 384 people by random cluster sampling, seeking to make a representative study of the population that is transported in Quito through a poll. The results determined that the population considers congestion as one of the main problems of the city. Meanwhile in research the perception of the population is presented about the various problems that generate traffic in the city. The vehicular increase and the lack of public transport use are analyzed as part of the results and finally the feasibility of using tools such as social networking identified as potencial tools to capture information that allows analyzing alternative solutions to traffic congestion. The study concludes with an analysis of both the main problems and potential solutions to improve traffic and the feasible use of social network Twitter as a tool for decision making for better efficiency of traffic by better use of routes by transportation means as vehicles, achieving research with an initial analysis, but critical to the implementation of potential solutions for decision making in improving traffic congestion in the city.},

abstract = {This work shows the use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques on vegetable crops data from a greenhouse by implementing the first version of a software tool, so called GreenFarm-DM. Such a tool is aimed at analyzing the factors that influence the growth of the crops, and determine a predictive model of soil moisture. Within a greenhouse, the variables that affect crop growth are: relative humidity, soil moisture, ambient temperature, and levels of illumination and CO2. These parameters are essential for photosynthesis, i.e. during processes where plants acquire the most nutrients, and therefore, if performing a good control on these parameters, plants might grow healthier and produce better fruits. The process of analysis of such factors in a data mining context requires designing an analysis system and establishing an objective variable to be predicted by the system. In this case, in order to optimize water resource expenditure, soil moisture has been chosen as the target variable. The proposed analysis system is developed in a user interface implemented in Java and NetBeans IDE 8.2, and consists mainly of two stages. One of them is the classification through algorithm C4.5 (chosen for the first trial), which uses a decision tree based on the data entropy, and allows to visualize the results graphically. The second main stage is the prediction, in which, from the classification results obtained in the previous stage, the target variable is predicted from information of a new set of data. In other words, the interface builds a predictive model to determine the behavior of soil moisture.},

abstract = {The Internet has transformed work dynamics and introduced new tasks, roles and types of content in the journalist's work. These transformations invite us to reflect on the skills and abilities that these communicators must acquire in order to be able to function with solvency in the work scenario. In this sense, communication faculties play a decisive role in achieving this task. Based on this, a comparative study is presented between four universities (Spain: Complutense of Madrid and Aut{\'{o}}noma of Barcelona; and Colombia: Sabana and Rosario, Ecuador: San Francisco University and Eqinoccia University) to find out what presence data journalism has in their respective curricula. In this way, the work analyzes the objectives, the type of subjects, the syllabus and the evaluation system, among other aspects, of the set of subjects of the curricular offer with the objective of identifying which themes and from which approach they work in each center.},

abstract = {This work presents an analysis of some terms related to Big Data, Hadoop, and their architecture; in addition, it presents the results of the analysis of undergraduate enrollment information of the distance system of Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja (UTPL), this information is extracted from academic system by using Hadoop framework as a big data processing platform; for that, a big data infrastructure has been designing and tested which is based on Hortonworks and Power View tools in order to present reports that helps managers to have metrics in order to improve their decision making. For this, a thorough search of information by using Hadoop framework, in which a synthesis of the different important terms was made, it reaches to determine different areas of application; in addition it presents a big data case study by of undergraduate enrollment information from academic system of UTPL by using the Hadoop framework. Consequently, it is concluded that Hadoop Framework helps us to process of big data sets, because it has Hadoop Distributed File System which provides an increased performance for data, and MapReduce process the data in parallel with the integration of Hortonworks and Power View tools which allow to analyze big data and to present reports in maps in order to analyze UTPL students enrollment.},

@article{Villegas-Ch2019,
abstract = {<p>Currently, the integration of technologies such as the Internet of Things and big data seeks to cover the needs of an increasingly demanding society that consumes more resources. The massification of these technologies fosters the transformation of cities into smart cities. Smart cities improve the comfort of people in areas such as security, mobility, energy consumption and so forth. However, this transformation requires a high investment in both socioeconomic and technical resources. To make the most of the resources, it is important to make prototypes capable of simulating urban environments and for the results to set the standard for implementation in real environments. The search for an environment that represents the socioeconomic organization of a city led us to consider universities as a perfect environment for small-scale testing. The proposal integrates these technologies in a traditional university campus, mainly through the acquisition of data through the Internet of Things, the centralization of data in proprietary infrastructure and the use of big data for the management and analysis of data. The mechanisms of distributed and multilevel analysis proposed here could be a powerful starting point to find a reliable and efficient solution for the implementation of an intelligent environment based on sustainability.</p>},

@article{Villegas-Ch2020,
abstract = {Currently, data are a very valuable resource for organizations. Through analysis, it is possible to profile people or obtain knowledge about an event or environment and make decisions that help improve their quality of life. This concept takes on greater value in the current pandemic, due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), that affects society. This emergency has changed the way people live. As a result, the majority of activities are carried out using the internet, virtually or online. Education is not far behind and has seen the web as the most successful option to continue with its activities. The use of any computer application generates a large volume of data that can be analyzed by a big data architecture in order to obtain knowledge from its students and use it to improve educational processes. The big data, when included as a tool for adaptive learning, allow the analysis of a large volume of data to offer an educational model based on personalized education. In this work, the analysis of educational data through a big data architecture is proposed to generate learning based on meeting the needs of students.},
